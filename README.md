# Random-Matrix-Theory

This repository stores the essense of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) analysis scripts:

1. chaotic system eigenvalue simulation basedd of RMT approach.

2. the tri-diagonal method for accelerating random matrix eigenvalue solving

3. characteristics of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, and Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GOE, GUE, and GSE).

4. short-range analysis of nearest neighbor level spacing statistics

5. spectrum un-folding with Weyl's Law.

6. one-point eigenfunction statistics
